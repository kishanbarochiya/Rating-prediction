0,4,🤩🤩🤩 I am very very happy😊😊
1,4,"👏👏 Delivery service is good 👍
This phone is a killer in this price range.
-------------------------------------------------------------
BUT
⚠️The phone is full of bloatware/unwanted apps which keep installing automatically when connected to internet, during device setup.
⚠️The storage (rom) uses emmc tech., which is slower compared to UFS storage.
Overall a killer ⭐⭐⭐"

Camera quality is very good.
Battery also good last upto 2 days.
Performance good like any other samsung mobile.
Sound quality is very good.

Pros:
1. Big Display + Good build quality
2. Sharp Colors
3. Good battery backup lasts for almost 1.5 days
4. Smooth touch + clean UI
5. No lags until now + no heating issue
6. Rear camera works pretty good in day light

Cons:
1. Front camera is average
2. No back cover provided
3. Feels little heavy in initial days but later gets used too it."
457,4,"Everything is good about this product, except the weight of the phone, which is 220 grams without cover and around 250 gram with front protection glass and back cover, and thickness is almost 10mm and when you put a cover it increases and now its thick and heavy..so not at all a handy phone. Could have given 5000mah battery and weight it around 190 grams. Then it would have been a go to smartphone at this price."
458,5,Overall performance is good for medium use. Battery life is pretty good. For those who's looking for playing High graphic games than don't go for it. Camera performance is also average. Not so high not that bad. It's Not perfect for Photography lover. And Yeah it's little bit heavy. Weight is around 240-250Gms.

669,4,"Superb Phone......

Don't look at the negative comments if you are not a heavy gamer (Pubg, Call of Duty, etc.). Light gaming like Subway Surfers, Temple Run runs very smoothly in this phone.

Pros:
1. Big Display (6.5 inch). Brightness and display quality is also good. 90hz display is also an advantage
2. Big Battery (6000 mAh). It gives 1 day battery backup after heavy usage and it may be used for 2 days on a single in light use.
3. Camera is decent. As always Samsung camera is very good.

Battery backup is simply awesome. I got 8+ hours SOT
Performance is way better than Xiaomi and realme at this range. Bloatware free and no junk apps. Previously i was a Motorola User so i miss Moto tweaks, thats all. This gap is fulfilled by Samsung one UI. lots and lots of customisation.
Samsung brand is trust. Phone is Durable and service centre are very helpful
This is myth exynos are not good. Trust me, in real life in doesnt matter until and unless you do heavy gaming at very high...

Good build quality
Pros:
Definitely the battery. It's real good
Display looks good.
No lags. Yet to try high storage games. Handles 6 to 7 apps seamlessly
Back camera is good.

Cons:
Selfie camera could ve been better. As Mi phones offer good camera quality for this price range
No back cover. Even simple one.
High wattage battery, but atleast takes 2hours to full charge."

Battery pick up also good

Everytime you note that samsung is BRAND.
BATTERY 🔋 is awesome 😉 take a long time to drain and
Runs 1 day with full charge .
Gaming performance is still good but not much.Like BGMI you play at low graphics then performance of this mobile is too good.
I like this phone 📱"
1750,5,"Good option for normal users. It will be good if a back case is provided along with the package. 6000mah battery might not as good as others. But for a Samsung phone this is the best option. Quad camera set is is just okay. Macro shots and all are just average. But the wide angle camera is the most attractive one in this price range. The display is fine. Much brighter and clearer one. The phone is little bulky but it won't be a problem for us. For gamers you may skip this phone. This is not ...

And the pros are
1 big battery
2 big storage
3 processor is all right
Cons
1 display not that good
2 camera is ok not upto the mark
3 audio is not upto the mark
You can go for micromax in note 1, it's far better than this"
1752,5,"Bought this as a second phone. Was looking for a cheap reliable one. So went for a Samsung phone. Given the price, the display, call clarity and performance are good. Camera is also reasonably good. But then if camera was main function one needed, the budget would have to be stepped up. So overall, a very good phone for everyday use"

Back camera is good and front is average
Battery backup is too good ! 6000 mh battery last long for almost 1 day of use!

Good things:

3. Decent RAM management.
4. Good update timeline.

1825,4,"Worst purchase ever. The voice breaks evry other second. We cannot complete any conversation without reconnecting 3-4 times. Tried with 3 different service provider sim, and the same sim tried on different phone to compare. It proved its the phone fault. Its a complete waste of money"

Bad camera quality
Wrost phone....."
1832,5,good product awsome
1833,5,Don't buy if you use 5Ghz broadband wifi as this mobile only supports 2.5ghz wifi bandwidth only. This is just a basic phone for tiktok gen users not professionals or high speed internet lover.
1834,4,Complete wastage of money. Display is worst. Cannot read screen due to extra whiteness. Screen movement slow. May be due to processor. Camera is worst. Samsung made fool . It's a complete waste of money.. Flipkart should arrange for replacement with better mobile with extra cost if a customer need. I am facing thermal throttling with my phone after using it for few hours with light usage. As this phone uses a powerful chipset this is not expected to happen.

2. 48 mega pixels are just to say, actually it doesn't perform as per 48MP."

5137,5,"First I would like to thank you Flipkart for fastest delivery and yah the delivery guy is so cooperative and helpful
Samsung phones are always best in performance and this one is also affordable and awesome phone"
5138,5,"Nice phone. We can rely on Samsung than any Chinese company like MI, Redmi, Poco, Realme, Vivo, Oppo etc.

Little heavy and thick than others but best in this price range. Rear and front cameras are superb.
Not has SAmoled display and you can't expect it in this price.
6000 mah battery is just wow. Power packed phone.

But the Charger is of 9V and there is mentioned that it is of 15V.

It did justice with its price. Value for money and trust of Samsung.

If you are willing for it, Go ahead 👍"
5139,5,"Nice
Phone in samsung budget series I love samsung products quality , after sale service , the support, security updates all in all great company ...."
5140,5,"Listing out only most desirable points to know from realtime usage. Others you'll find on online reviews.

Pros:
Efficient battery. It doesn't go well with gaming though
Handling the device is easy for people like who spend a lot of time outdoors, given you equip with a right case
Good build - surely will last for 4 years without intentional or accidental physical stress

Cons:
Mediocre camera for this segment. At this price you'll get awesome image quality from Mi, Realme and others.

5141,4,Nice Phone especially bought for battery backup. Its battery backup is awesome. Pretty good camera and everything at all nice phone.
5142,5,"Literally the best of Samsung in this price range.

Camera quality is really good, not the best, but OK.
The 48mp rear camera is the best, other three cams are not upto the mark. The selfish camera is better.

Battery lasts upto 1 day even on continuous use but it takes time for charging.

It is not recommended for gamers, but for a regular user or student who uses for attending online classes, calls, multitasking, It is highly recommended.

Display is amazing. Adaptive 90hz display is very s...

5144,5,"First impressions of this not good with front camera

Average it good but not the best not good for value for money for my side"
5145,5,"Like it's camera is is like 48mp.
It's take too much time to charge.
I recommend realme narzo 30a on place of this phone. Realme is better then samsung .
It's has very less features.
It doesn't have even Restrict background data . Or data speedo meter.
It's screenshot taking method is worst.
It's has soo many pre installed app that we could not delete.
I repete REALME IS BETTER THEN SAMSUNG."
5146,5,Display is ok ok..as compare to AMOLED screen.Other things like battery and hardware performance is perfect..4gb Ram and 128 gb is nice combination..Overall phone is good in this budget.

My earlier phone redmi note4 was too good. I used for 4 years without any issues. This one I found more attractive and smarter. Sound quality is very good. After all the deal was value for money. You can buy it without a doubt.

6489,5,"The phone looks great in appearance. Fully black tinted glass pops out its nex gen looks. See Green gives compliment with whole black display. Precisely it is teal color not sea green. Touch (scroll up and down or sideways) is very smooth. Battery lasted from 24 Hours on 50% on mediocre use. Wi Fi connects fast and working nicely.

Now with cons (there are multiple)
Display is very very bad. It is smoky white rather than bright white. Colors are very dull.
There is over brightness on display...

6490,5,The camera optimization is very poor. The 48Mp's photo looks like captured from 2Mp camera and the macro shot is nightmate. But yaa seamless experience as compared to Xiaomi or any other Chinese phones as there are no ads and the UI is light and it feels very fast in using. The battery is a plus point for this phone. I personally liked the UI as compared to MIUI with no bloatwares and ads popping out in middle of the work which is in the case of MIUI
6491,5,This mobile f12 is absolute value for money with a excellent battery back up uptown 5 days but it is very thick and the display of this is not as much better but satisfying and the front camera is also not good but overall performance of this mobile is excellent in this price range.so if you are think of buying it then your choice is correct.
6492,4,Ph is looking good & camera is awesome but some features are missing as per the comparison of MI 9 PRIME & let me see in future how is it work ?
6493,5,This Phone is awesome in this price point it has some graet features and I liked this Phone The display is HD+ but it fells like FHD+ the colurs and contrast are very good.And also the delivery boy was very cooperative
6494,5,"The best phone among all on this price range
Camera is awesome. Battery is monster. Everything is just perfect. So happy to buy it
Thank you Samsung Thank you flipkart.👍"
6495,4,"Phone is very good but there is no screen guard and phone cover , Samsung should give this.

Every thing is fine but i don't like the camera quality , specially the front 8 MP selfie camera is not good and back camera is OK not bad ."
6496,5,"This is a good phone.A smart phone useful to the common man. But since it is a heavy phone, it cannot be used flexibly. Airtel SIM -internet connection is poor. The camera is good. Has voice clarity. The display is good. Performance is better. Battery capacity is excellent.

This phone is recommended👍"
6497,5,"The phones look is not very good, it's a bit more thik and heavy as compare to other phones. Design wise not up to the mark, although features are good and even the quality of the phone is good
If you are a samsung fan you can go for it but if not you should definitely go for the POCO M3 it is better than this phone, it's display is full hd where as samsung F12 has only has hd display and all other features are same but inters of Design definitely POCO M3 wins."
6498,4,Phone look is awesome best suited for official use ...Firstime#samsung Thank u filpkart for speedy delivery
6499,4,"Phone was delivered per time frame.....
If asking about the phone, best phone for the person who is Starting to get a touch of technology or for a light user
Best thing about the phone is the Samsung One UI
Its the twin brother of M12 > Same features ,there is no even a slight change
Other than that there is nothing else to post
If you want best value for money at this price range go for ""POCO""
Or you need a lesser priced samsung device go for M11"
6500,3,"This is the best phone if you are looking for under 10000. It's performance is best. In some of the 4 gb ram mobile phone if you will open heavy games like cod mobile,free fire,etc and then go to the recent tab and open them they will restart but in this it doesn't restart. That's a good thing of it. It's camera is only a bad thing as there should be more modes for camera. However this phone is excellent"
6501,4,"This review isnt for mobile because i just received and too say something it is little but hurry.
But the commitment the Area manager fulfilled of Jassola Location ( South Delhi ) is remarkable.
I just received a phone within 24 Hours due to Birthday of my younger brothet on Next day after order placed.
Thankyou very much for the instant service and a delivery person a most humble person.

6516,3,The phone doesn't connect to a normal wifi which supports 5GHZ. It is nowhere mentioned and flipkart is not ready to replace it. Please DO NOT BUY this phone.
6517,5,This product is very bad. Totely west of money this purchase mobile phone . Mobile preference is very bad .so feel like crying.
6518,5,Third class camera front camera is like 2mp little bit heavy
6519,5,this product do not worth. it has very very poor camera quality. this is a worst product of SAMSUNG. never buy it. Samsung just cheating trusted customers. I had technician visit he also told me that this phone has poor worst camera quality. I requested refund but there is no refund. I did not received any refund and lost all my money.
6520,5,"This phone is really best for me in this range of money.. first class camara, heavy processor, 6000 mh battery,beautiful display. It's really fantastic phone."
6521,5,"This is a really bad phone. The quality of the camera is pathethic. It says 48MP but honestly the quality of the camera is not more than 4MP.

If you are looking for a phone with good camera quality, please dont but this. I have requested multiple times Flipkart to return the product, but rather than answering their call centre disconnect the phone."

6609,5,There is one thing that i definitely hoped they will give as i saw the feature existing in samsung f02 but its missing. Sms should allow deleting multiple emails from one button but here it needs to be selected manually only then can be deleted. Also front camera is miserable. For these reasons i feel samsung f02 was a better choice unfortunately its out of stock hence i had to go for this. This one is for father f02 was for mother . I feel mother phone is more user friendly compared to dad.

WiFi Module supports 2.4 Ghz only. It does not include 5 Ghz WiFi. This is a big limitation in my opinion. Also, the phone Specifications say ""WiFi = Yes"" which is misleading.

6690,4,Phone is Excellent
6691,5,Charge slow
6692,4,Phone is a bit heavy because of the big battery. Otherwise its value for money. If back cover is also provided it would have been great. Samsung should increase charger cord length for all its phones.
6693,3,The phone is not worth the price. Redmi phones at this price come with a better performance and UI. Samsung has limited the theme customisation unlike redmi or other brands. You have to pay for premium themes. The screen or camera is not as expected. Overall the phone is okay but not really worth the price.

6951,4,"If I am going with brand name SAMSUNG then it should be like super but in samsung f12 disappointed me . It's camera quality is not good ,it is 48 mp camera .
If anybody want to buy this for thinking good camera I recommended to go with Realme.
Battery backup also less ."
6952,4,"After using 4 to 5 days ...
Camera is just OK not disappointed
Battery is super more than 2 day if you are a normal user ...
Display is also good ..
Processor is also good
Over all phone is good in this price range .
You can go for it ...."
6953,4,Affordable phone in this range...I like it
6954,5,If you want to go with Samsung in budget price then this phone is yours.
6955,5,If you are typical samsung mobile user and want big battery and more internal space under 12000 rs... Then definitely this phone is for you...
6956,5,If u r looking for battery oriented beast then must go for it. I m a heavy user GPS Data always on still battery works for 1.5 day easily. Camera performance is not the best but excellent in this price segment. Samsung UI is good. Just go for it u won't regret..
6957,4,"After 4 to 5 hours continous browse it will work slow,charging is good,camera average, some heating issue while charging also heating issue,more weight and also not slim"
6958,5,After 10 days circuits are burned.. Samsung is not providing quality products at lower costs.. They will only give quality if it is more than 50k
6959,5,"After 7 days use..

Pros....
Good screen 6.5inch
The battery can last for one day with heavy usage, for normal use can go up to 1.5 to 2 days
It's safe, it's not Chinese.
Exynos 850 is good enough for normal use, not for heavy games like COD.

Cons
Both cameras are just ok, it's like 13MP, 48MP is a false claim to lure customers.
Comes with bloatware, don't worry you can remove most of them.
No LED notification


CONCLUSION
If you are not a heavy gamer it's the best option out there.
GO...

6972,4,Offer price … best Phone
6973,5,"After seeing so many good reviews, I bought this phone. This phone is super awesome in its price range. What else you want in 10K, 4 GB RAM,64 GB storage, so nice user interface, super awesome battery, OK OK camera quality but it is good in day light. I have a IPhone and I bought it as a secondary phone. I really loved this that I use this phone more than my iPhone. Afterall SAMSUNG is far better than other Chinese Vivo OPPO in the market."
6974,5,After two month of purchase sim 2 slot is not working. This is very poor impact. First time i am using samsung mobile and i think 2nd time i am not going to purchase the same brand
6975,4,After using 45 days the experience is not good. Network problem facing. I have Other Samsung mobile and at the same area galaxy 12 had Network connection problems. Camera is good but not best. Don't go for this model.
6976,3,"If u compare the camera with other realme and redmi phones, the f12 is so much better, I like everything except the finger print part, I wish the finger print should be the back rather than side mount, because when we use back cover, I feel trouble opening."

My last fone was Motorola Moto C and I used it for four years and it is still working no parts of this fone was become non functional

I am very disappointed with this fone"
6981,5,After using for 2 months all I can say is camera quality is worst than 13 mp camera . Processor is OK .best to choose other phone than this phone.I can suggest buy something else than Samsung.
6982,5,If you want a good camera phone never go with this phone. You will disappoint. Worst possible camera. Even samsung galaxy m20 has much better camera.

6986,4,"Personally i feel the design of this phone is very nice and impressive.
Camera quality is good in this price point.
Performance is also good in this range
Battery life is good but it doesn't support fast charging so i didn't feel good about it.
Display isn't good ,cheap display i am very Disappoint for it.....
Overall you can buy this but if you want good display so don't buy it."
6987,4,"Review after 3 month of use:

1)Camera and battery backup are upto the mark...4/5
2)Screen or display is bit disappointed as resolution not that good .but its ok for this price tag...3/5
3) Performance is good if you are using genral purpose.but not that good or smooth for playing high resolution games like COD or PUBg.3/5
4)it definitely a value for money and more important it is not Chinese . If Samsung improve and more features in One UI .also it has samsung ads or bloatware .4/5"
6988,4,"Really loved the build quality.........smudgeproof 😍
Display is quite bright what I expected it got more brightness. Battery is huge 6000mAh & u can use it for 1 - 1.5days straight without any issue also u can get 2days if u r a light user.
Camera is also the best as always........Thanks @Samsungindia for that.
Regarding the performance I would like to say..........it's Much power efficient rather than powerful one.
In short,It's a value for money device from SAMSUNG."
6989,5,"Reviewing after 2 days use. Mobile has heating problem while usingand charging. Overall features are best. Go for this mobile. But you can't use this mobile for high level gaming like PUBG,BGMI and FREE FIRE. For gaming purchase Media Teck Helio G or P processor mobiles. I love this phone😇. The features are just awesome and you can't compare to other mobiles. Such a best display, sound and fingerprint sensor at power key,call background features....awesome...awesome and awesome 👌"

6992,5,"Best mid range mobile from samsung , back camera is good but front camera is avarage. Performance is good although good phone in this price range."
6993,4,"Recently bought samsung m21 for father which had oled screen so expected f12 to be better than that but turned out to be far less than m21 for almost same price. Poor screen color, poor camera, wifi also only 2.4 gz and not 5 gz. One good camera would have been sufficient instead of 4 bad cameras. Pics captured look like artificially painted. Worst boot time. Looks great only from outside, but internal are strip down like anything. Samsung should stop fooling people."

6998,4,Selfie camera is not much good as expected. Main camera is ok. But the rest of all the performance is the best I loved it too much. The 90hz display performs like pro. Very very fast response of screen. Battery lasts whole day long for online classes. Overall it's a beast in this budget.
6999,4,Very nice mobile phone...I am feeling very happy after received this product.... Camera is well ..... And thanks to flipkart for delivery in very short time a carefully also....

Camera quality is very good. Battery backup is also amazing. You get everything that you expect from a mid range phone. The power button is the finger print sensor.
The drawback that i found was that notification light is missing."

1549,5,Don't buy this phone. Completely loss of money. If they give atleast a 13mp camera that will be much better. You are spending about 11000 and the camera quality is like VGA camera. Not even Megapixel. One can go for pcco M3 or samsung F12 at this range.

3520,4,"The build of the phone is very good and packaging was very good but transparent cover was not given by seller and the front camera is worth 8mp but the rear camera is not worth 50mp.
It also does not have many applications like
Photo Gallery,
Security Scanner,
File Manager,
Speed Connection etc.
Overall, I would like to give 4 star out of 5 star."

3639,4,This is a third class product. It has lot of problem
3640,4,"The mobile does not have 5g wifi connectivity, which is basic norm for a phone, camera is just a show piece, very unhappy with quality"
3641,3,Photo does not slide on mobile one photo open at the one time
3642,5,The camera is very poor and not at all matching with the description. 50MP camera is not even having 5MP clarity. The display is average. Battery life is good. Rigid home screen mode you can't switch from drawer to standard. No store for thems and wallpapers. This range phone should have FHD display and C type charging port. Go for othe brand if you are investing that much money.

3669,4,This phone is not worth at all and there isn't any refund policy so I'm very disappointed. Please don't buy any phone from flipkart. Their technician has no credibility now I don't buy any electronic product from flipkart. Flipkart cheated with me.

3672,5,This item is very bad please don't waste your money
3673,5,"The specifications of the model is quite good according to its price. But the main problem lies in its interface. The interface kinda looks outdated and is hard to customize. There are no apps for themes or galleries, instead, a lot of redundant apps of realme are there. There is hardly anything to change in the settings."
3674,5,This mobile is so many problems after use
3675,5,This is not a gaming phone if u use multiple app not gaming app then go and buy this. Camera quality is good night photoshoot is so so. If u r a camera lover then ignore this device.

Everything is great , Stock android is just awesome

The Camera app itself lacks features"

Auto Brightness seems to be not working always adjusting brightness manually

Speaker sound quality is very poor like 2000 Rs phone

Mostly two hands needed to operate with one hands very difficult

I am planning to return but somehow flipkart is not accepting

Basically I am one of the guy love...

I have had a great experience with Moto One Power (4GB | 64GB). Such a magnificent device it is. Unfortunately that is not in stock now. That drove and influenced me to have a Moto mobile again.

Clean UI, No non-sense advertisements like most of the other brands, No bloatware, Good RAM management, Fantabulous Moto gestures.

But let me tell u one thing u can play BGMI❤️ very smooth but only in hd u can't play BGMI game even In HDR and ulta HD too..

Other vise for normal uses best phone and u definitely gona ove this...❤️🥰🥰"
858,5,"Every thin was not great in this mobile phone.....
1. Camer quality is just ok
2. No magneto meter or compass sensor
3. No stereo speakers
4. Little bit hefty
5. Less Ram options
But if these points are not at all deal breakers we can go with this mobile as it has
1. Decent screen quality
2. Great battery life
3. Clean and adds free UI very close to stock android
4. Moto gestures
5. Decent processor
From day one I am the big fan of motorola devices but day by day it is loosing its mark with...

859,5,"Everything is a pro, Excellent buttery smpoth display, Faster UI, Great battery life, Except rear camera. It's 108MP but pics are not clear. Front camera pic's are decent."
860,5,"Ive been using this phone for 4 months now.

PROS
1 The near stock android experience is very good (its actualy better than stock android moto action are one of the most used feature in this phone by me)

2 camera is above average

3 non usable storage is much less because of no blotware apps (12gb/128gb)

4 punch hole camera is better than u v or notch

5 assured one day useble battery for simple users it will last for two days

6 moto gesture helpful in many situations shake to turn on...

861,5,"Overall, a great product from Motorola considering it's price tag. Gaming is smooth thanks to Snapdragon! Battery lasts for around 2days with regular usage. Camera is good but not among the best ones out there. Again, with it's price tag, you can't really complain about getting the best aspects in all areas. If you aren't camera-obsessed this phone is really among the best ones in the market rn. Its 4.5/5 for me!"
862,5,"Overall a good mobile for regular use

Pros: Clean UI, best battery, good performance, decent display
Cons: Camera is a big disappointment, Display is decent not great"
863,5,"Overall OK, but don't go with its 108 mp camera. It works like 13 mp camera or even low. Display is wrost. Overall performance is ok but if you want a camera phone with good display never ever go for it."
864,5,Everyone who's saying camera is bad well in daylight conditions photos are awesome you just have to take a perfect shot not just point and shoot... And for other things this phone is phenomenal
865,5,"Even though many customer friendly in-built apps may be missing, this stock android phone with enormous battery backup will be a feel-good experience for a normal mobile phone user, who prefers to stay away from the marketed apps. As clear from reviews, primary camera is not that exciting, but the flash quality is unexpectedly good for dim light conditions. Worth the money!!!"
866,4,Overall a great phone it is. Software is clean and i was able to play cod quite easily in this. Display is good and battery lasts about 24 hours when used heavily. Camera is good and the ultra res(108MP) captures some really nice and detailed pics.One drawback i noticed was the time taken to charge the phone fully. It takes atleast 2-2.5 hrs to fully charge the device.
867,5,Overall phone is good you should buy it
868,3,Everything is good in Phone📱and Camera quality is also Awesome📸👍
869,5,Everything is perfect and camera is good
870,5,Overall awesome phone. I wish Motorola charge 18999 for this phone but include amoled panel and reduce its weight below 200g. In future we expect from Motorola to place fingerprint scanner on screen or side mounted.
871,4,"Overall phn is ok....nice...good...bt i think display refresh rate is creating problem...it getting very slowed down....i think mobile needs more uodate...
Otherwise the mobile is very good....u can buy this....."
872,5,"Everything is ok except voicing. Our voice is not audible ,the atmosphere noise is high While voicing in whatsapp , while recording the voice in voice recorder app, while recording the call. I replaced the phone for this complaint now I received a new one. The new phone is also facing the same complaint. So this model Moto g60 is not good for voicing and call recording. All the other this are ok."
873,5,Overall it's a good product Display and camera quality is good.so I like it
874,5,Average phone below average camera
875,5,Everything is ok but call recording is not given that is the mines point
876,5,Everything is super awesome but when you use 120 hertz display battery drains little fast but except that everything is good.I was so much confused in buying phone but finally I bought this and believe me this is one of the best phone in this range. EXTREMELY SATISFIED.
877,5,Over weight due to large battery
878,5,"Everything is good except Camera. Camera is also good, but not reached as mentioned/expected (108MP). Images looking like normal Camera only."

Display is good enough, but in extreme light conditions you have to struggle to read.
Performance is good."
886,5,Everything is good except camera as per my expectations. Moto needs to improve it and feels little bulky also.

Mainly the camera is good
The battery is about 1 day 5hrs
Charge time approx 2 hrs with 20watt turbo charge
Sound quality is good with single speaker enough louder
4G + is good network bands NFC also works fine
And I mostly like the moto gestures
Dubbe chop for flashlight
The biggest disadvantage is the phone is too heavier 220gms
I expect the weight balance could be done some what better"

933,5,Overall good phone nice one

940,3,"Over all performance is ok 👍
As expected too bulky and heavy height but battary backup is very very good ..
Camera is average, not true 108 megapixel Same as my previous model mi note 5 pro nither as my note 10 pro
Heating when continue video call of 20 mins
No bloating issue 👍
Over all it good for normal users"
941,3,"Overall performance of the phn is good just few cons:
1. Phn is lit heavier,
2. There is no inbuilt gallery n AppLock.
Otherwise overall phn is good n main thing is has stock android so no ads or notification is + point."
942,4,Overall okay. Just that the display is a little less brighter compared to even to the less cheaper narzo 30 5g which I also have. So on screen after you take a photograph the picture doesn't look that impressive but when you enlarge and see the details it is a sharper image. No problem in media viewing though.
943,5,Over all good in this price

949,5,Everything is fine but the back of the mobile is spotted very quickly and I think the camera quality should have been better.
950,5,"Overall Moto G60 is Perfect just one drawback Feels Thick in Hands.
Camera is Awesome.
Battery is Also Good.
Budget Phone which gives you Electronic Stabilization in 4K in Rear and Front both.

Only drawback I feel is that the phone is bit heavy compared to other/similar phone, but is not a deal breaker."

1077,5,"Overall specifications wise phone is very good as there were no performance issues.
Good battery backup, lasted 1 Day 18 hours with moderate usage. 6000 mAh battery has led to increased thickness and weight of phone which could an issue for some.
I'd recommend this to users with moderate users with reasonable affordability."

Performance - performance is also okay but sometimes mobile hangs for 2-3 seconds. It might be due to some virus transmitted in mobile through application. Otherwise works faster."

This is the first phone which breaks my trust from Motorola. I've been using moto from past several years and this in 5 motorala phone in my family and 3rd mine. Many features like internal app lock is missing. I'm very disappointed, flash and camera didn't sink. Moto degraded its quality. Don't buy!"

1981,5,Its an excellent smartphone. Love it.
1982,5,"Stock android, 6000 mAH battery, large and vibrant display, software support for next 3 android updates, are it's USP.

Camera is disappointing. It takes 2 - 3 seconds time to process the pic after it is clicked. Pics quality is far away from 108 MP.

I have been trusting Motorola since last many years. Considering this is 4G phone and future belongs to 5G, I will not recommend to buy this mobile. Better you go for Motorola's 5G mobile phones."
1983,5,"It's a heavy phone. After using it, Every other phone feels like feather.

Camera is ok ok, I mean not up to the mark, not expected from Moto.

Else everything is 5 star. Display, battery, performance, calling quality, sound, features, OS, you name it.

Snapdragon gives the juice to perform for multitasking, which is even more aided by stock android experience.

Its competitors are either on expensive side (Redmi , Realme, Samsung with 7xx SOC) or having an overloaded UI, which eventually drains ba...

The camera has OIS but it rarely shows up in the photos you take, also the night vision is so bad it cannot be even compared to other cameras of even poco. We expect a far more better device from Moto, they really need to up their game, if they wana stay in the race."
2193,5,It is a best Phone under 20000 and there are many features in this phone the camera quality is so good

2208,5,"It's a phone worth every penny. Highlights are camera, battery, performance, and free from ads.
Many other phones for the same features price products expensively. Motorola gives absolutely value for money ."
2209,4,"It's a decent phone for its price. It doesn't have a built in Parallel Apps feature like OnePlus where you can use WhatsApp with two different numbers. You can do using different Apps like Multi Parallel, but they contain a lot of ads. Hopefully they should introduce it via software update.

Apart from that, the phone would meet the expectations for its price."

2462,5,Writing a review after 2 months of usage. Very good buy. Smooth performance. No lag whatsoever during gaming. No heating as well. The 108 mp camera does the job but it's not something that is significantly different from the moto g40 fusion I guess. The best part is the clean and fast stock android experience this phone offers at this range.
2463,5,Great mobile all things are good. No cons all things are good. Must buy phone under 20k... No cons only pros good display better than amoled panel. Speaker is decent loud & clear...good performing cameras both back & front.. Comes with carrier aggregation means great network... Stock Android better than many Chinese brands.. If u looking for a value mobile than go for it..

Camera : Camera Performs Well In Natural Light Conditions but camera degrades in artificial light conditions and performs horrible.So camera is 3/5.

2703,5,"Great Mobile, Nice battery backup and camera. Overall a great purchase 👍"
2704,5,Around 18k more options is available in this mobile
2705,5,Great
2706,5,Grate mobile.
2707,4,"Processor is good
But 108mp camera is not working properly..low quality camera 😵😵"
2708,5,Great phone in this segment.
2709,5,"Pretty satisfied with this device (Moto G60). It met my expectations and it can be considered to be one of the best mid-ranged smartphones.
Battery, connectivity, display, performance, all are up to the mark. Camera works best in daylight but needs improvement in low light conditions."
2710,5,Great phone highly recommended
2711,3,"Arrow straight product,delivers what it promises sans the 108 mp"
2712,5,Great value in its Range
2713,5,Great for value of money exlent
2714,5,Great phone👌👌👌👌
2715,4,"Pros: Ad free experience,battery life,good hardware.

Cons:
1) Not good camera. Don't think about good quality just by looking at 108 mp. Front camera is bad as well. Motorola really needs a camera upgrade in terms of software.
2) phone is very big,bulky, heavy. My father has galaxy m51. That has 7000 mah battery. This moto g60 has 6000 mah battery. Still this is bigger, fatter than m51.

Note: (most important)
If you are unhappy after using the phone, you can't return it. I mean you will no...

2716,5,"Pros: good performance, decent display and battery
Cons: bulky, 108mp camera is waste of money. Even my 48mp camera give same quality"
2717,3,Price range is very High this is price range give Super AMOLED display Samsung and redmi companys
2718,5,Front flash isn't working after 10 days of usage
2719,5,Great product so far.
2720,4,"Pros- Camera is upto the mark with various new features added. The battery life is also good but it needs to be seen how it will behave when it becomes a tad older. The color and texture are fine.

Cons- The removal of navigation buttons create confusion sometimes. There are a lot of functions which are not written anywhere and the manual given is completely useless"
2721,4,Great phone with nice Cemara.....UI is superb...overall cool!!!!!
2722,5,Wrost product.
2723,5,Great must but
2724,5,Tq
2725,4,Tq Flipkart
2726,4,App clone not features this model C25-Y
2727,4,Speakers is bonguru sounds
2728,5,Speckers are pathetic
2729,5,Spr camera
2730,4,Speaker and cameras quality is not good and average
2731,4,Speakar valume is very less and no type c charging
2732,4,"Gps, bluetooth not working. Lot of additional features are not available. No dual app permission. Camera clarity was not good enough for 50mp cam. Overall device performance is very bad."
2733,4,Speaker problem and phone hang
2734,5,speaker quality very bad
2735,5,Operating software issues. Automatically working.
2736,3,"Speaker poor.
Touch screen sensitivity less than redmi note 7 pro.
Camera average- front camera captures natural colours than the AI enhanced ones on redmi which is good.
Back camera average Havent tried night shots
Battery back up great.
Average speakers in terms of volume and quality of sound.

Bulky,heavy and unwieldy.

Flipkart packaging extremely poor.The cardboard box of flipkart had completely crumbled and there was no other support like thermocols.Dust had settled on the phones box."
2737,4,Spr
2738,5,"Upgraded to Moto g60. Compass app did not work. When investigated the phone is missing magnetometer/compass sensor hardware.
My 4 year old Moto g5 had that sensor."
2739,5,"Spot on Motorola, excellent and worth every penny I send on this.
It's all awesome"
2740,5,Apart from weight it's good
2741,3,Sprrrrr ..loved it 💓💓💓💓
2742,5,Speakers and camera are worst to the core. After 5 mins of music the speaker creates noise and camera is worst.
2743,4,Speakers could have been better. Rest is just okay for the price
2744,5,Applications open and run very slow.
2745,3,apart from its display all good
2746,5,Option are not as per Other Android phone. Not meeting my requirements
2747,5,"Application functioning not working properly.the issue is detected initially but the service support not available in my area.
During functioning the application severing detected and last option is restart the mobile."
2748,5,Speaker And mike sound are very bad and husky
2749,5,"App lock feature is not available, rest is best"
2750,5,"Speed and performance is good, but the hyped camera is not worth it, software should be good to handle situations rather than all time having to adjust as per situations, night time video and photos are not good"
2751,5,"Specifications are Good, specifically Screen refresh rate and android stocked gives really smooth experience to operate"
2752,5,Speed is not as expected from a 6 gb RAM mobile. Signal istrength is also weak. Overall performance is just same as a 3gb ram mobile of other brands
2753,4,Operating is difficult not like other make
2754,3,"Update: 23/02/2022:

Good clean stock Android phone. Very smooth and fast. Very good display.
No issues till now after 6 month usage.
Solidly durable, fell from pocket at 40kmph no scratch on screen.
Fingerprint magnet.
Motorola should increase support for accessories like matte screen guard and cases, good quality ones were difficult to find."
2755,3,"Speed, performance, Battery, Storage, call clarity, - excellent, camera is ok,. Still getting unwanted ads inbetween, I was a iphone user, compared to iphone it's far better except camera."
2756,5,Apart from weight other features are good
2757,3,"Updates after couple of months:
--------------------------------------
Pathetic phone please don't get trapped. Very poor camera and pictures quality for this 17k phone.. battery life for a very normal usage is only one day which is pathetic for its fatty battery. DISPLAY INTERFACE STARTS FLICKERING NOW meaning touch panel randomly selects spots and phone keeps opening apps and doing on its own .. Believe me I have used iphone lot and reason I switched to iphone was due to poor android experi...

I certainly did some comparisons too and found it to be strong in its appeal.
Well in future company should try keeping the quality hallmark at it's best position other things comes secondary."

The camera is good in daylight, Motorola needs to make an update for low-light scenarios. Because the same sensor in Redmi Note 10 Pro Max with the same processor can take better low-light images.
Other than that it's good.
Would have liked to seen 960fps slo-mo(processor supports it)

Worst product from Motorola. It boast of it's 108MP camera but photo isn't as par 64MP also. Attached is the photo taken with Moto G60 with 108MP setting. See the photo and judge urself. U can't expect Pixelated photos from 108 MP.

Worst return/replacement policy from Flipkart. Technicians visit to check the phone but they simply rely on some software to check with other Moto G60 device but undermine the ground reality of the phone's camera.

No...

4605,5,Mobile sound and image/camera quality is very poor.
4606,4,Don't buy. simple word me....

4610,5,"Don't bye this phone waste of money, worst camera I have ever seen"
4611,5,"Got it at 14.5k,
Observations:
Performance: 9/10
Battery : 9/10
Rear Camera: 8.5/10
Front camera: 9/10
Build: 6/10 (a little too heavy & thick)
Display: 6.5/10

Stock android experience is worthwhile

The only significant downsides are the rear camera & extra thick & heavy build.
But when compared with all other features
& the fact that it's not Chinese,
This is one of the best deals."
4612,4,"Good camera, HDR, and
Stock android experience with 120hz display

Well equipped with 6000 mah battery and smooth operation makes it a good choice than redmi and other Chinese brands phone.As of now not much heating issue.
Hope it will not disappoint me for further 1-2 years."

4626,4,"Moto G60 is a good phone. But buying it with replacement policy is a concern especially from flipkart.

When you have some problem with the device, don't even think about the replacement. The replacement policy is just for namesake. If you do not worry about replacement policy, it is the best phone available in the market for now."

5290,5,"Honest Review after 1 month. Moto brand name is very good, but don't fully trust on this brand name, as G60 provides 108 mp camera but actually it's not looking like that. Image quality is not upto the mark, it could be more better than the actual quality. Macro is worst. Blur effect is looking good but if you zoom it then it will looks worst. Battery life is very very good. Set is bit hardy, overweight. Call clarity, touch, display is good with 120hz refresh rate. Don't hangs, works smoothly...

But this phone is not suitable for person who loves music.

Speaker sound and audio Equalizer is disgusting (surely need a update for Equalizer),
Please add a music player with a enhanced quality Equalizer with features loke jazz, pop, rock, hip hop, party, dance, classic, custom, etc

Also it needs to reduce the charging time."

the display is big (6.8) is pretty good and handy in my case
also, the 120hz is awesome
if your main motive is high gaming go for Poco but if you want a big screen+6000mah battry+a decent gaming snapdragon 732g+stock experience
GO FOR MOTO G60"
6745,5,Indian product is very awesome......camera & charging very good ...i am take the MOTOROLA mobile is very good product ....
6746,5,One bad thing is rarely restarting automatically. Lost my important office call
6747,4,On this of price point I am satisfied with this baby moto
6748,5,Intermediatly automatic working in display.
6749,5,Invoice not download error
6750,3,One of the worst mobile of my life. Totally waste of money.
6751,3,One word I say superb phone this budget...
6752,4,"One of the worst camera quality I had ever seen, it's not 108MP don't go by thier camera & display quality is average. Better go for Samsung"
6753,5,Only display not uptomark.
6754,5,One of best performing phone in the range. Camera and display are decent. The screen backlight is rather low that may cause visibility issue in sunlight.
6755,3,"Only liked it for stock android and good battery life, camera is very bad...."
6756,5,"Only battery not performing likes 6000MAh
It's like 3000 or something more but not 6000"
6757,5,infact the best phone i have purchased till now. batter capacity is too good. i charge the phone once in a day. its been over a month im using this phone and then ik writing this review. no problem with the phone till now. camera is too good. affordable price to get a phone with this much good features.
6758,5,Only 1 issue... Dual sim or single sim with sd card can run
6759,5,"An Average phn which overpriced.
I have ordered G60 from Flipkart and the moment I recieved and unboxed the phone I felt that this phn looks really cheaply built quality. I have been using it for over 3 days and My reviews of this are:
Display: An average phn display which has no special feature
Camera: Both front and back cameras are good but not upto the mark what picture lovers expects.
Battery: The charging speed is very poor as it takes about 7-9 hrs to complete 100%. Though the battery ...

6760,5,"Initially I was bit hesitant about choosing Moto, but decided to go for it. There is no much difference between G40 and G60. You can choose G40 over this. The phone is bulky because of huge battery. Charging speed is low ( can say very average). The phone operation is smooth. More than one mo th of usage and didn't find any issue.

Camera are average. But it is realistic. Not enhances anything like Redmi or other brand in this segment."

6769,5,In 8-10 days my phone Moto G 60 started to give issues with audio/sound of the phone during calls. It becomes totally blank and I have to redial multiple times. Some times the screen gets blank and flickers. The phone was supplied by Jeeves Consumer Services private Ltd.
6770,4,One SIM Slot appears empty again and again & when I restart my phone SIM works again.
6771,5,One of the worst mobile
6772,4,Android 11 updated but not New in mobile itself like old mobile
6773,5,"Initial impressions are great. The phone feels solid in hand. Phone has better grip as it is narrow,so it is easy to hold. Screen is huge, definitely not meant for single handed use. 120hz refresh rate does make a difference. Screen animations feel super smooth. Battery backup is great. There is very less idle battery drain. Screen on time is almost 6+ hours for a normal user. Moto would've provided 30W or atleast 25W charger. Charging does take little time as it is 6000mah battery.

8103,3,"Hi added my review after two weeks ,Camera is ultimate ,And battery performance also Good.In ultra resolution camera the photos were awesome and it's upto u how to Click the Photos and all.Display bright ness Quite low .Need to add some features like Gallery and Note pad ."
8104,5,"Highly recommended over Xiaomi phones especially the buggy Note 10 series


Most important the experience is advt free and fast near to stock android and no spammy notifications

Dont believe any reviewers on the camera ... Camera quality is natural n very good.

Display is excellent inspite of being not AMOLED"
8105,4,"Display- its a good display and most people will enjoy consuming content on this...

Design- very bulky n huge...others brands also provide huge batteries but those are light n slim enough for comfortable usage but moto g60 is a huge n bulky phone...so design won't impress alot..

Battery- great battery backup

Software- i always use stock android and so for me its nothing new...its nice and smooth as always

Camera- above average..takes good shots during good lighting conditions but struggle...

8106,5,"Nice phone same as expected
Pros : very reasonable price
And all the features mentioned in the box

Cons:
1. adaptive display is not accurate need to adjust manually when coming from outside

2. Display is not that much bright

3. Camera is average

My suggestion is to go for it.
Its more reliable, durable as all moto phone does

I already had moto g4 plus,moto one power.
And never disappointed with moto."
8107,3,Highly recommended mobile for this budget becouse I'm use multiple brands this budget segment but moto g60 very impressed to me under 16000 don't think too much blindly buy this mobile it's very very impressed to me.
8108,4,Nice phone and thankyou so much flipkart for getting me the best offer with an option to exchange the old one... This one is a nice phone..i also read reviews here on flipkart and decided to go for it..
8109,5,"Nice phone great built quality and works very smooth.
Based on usage every thing works quite good
Battery awesome backup
Screen refresh rate is also great no lags and no issue while plying heavy games like asphalt 9 legends and PUBG.

the only thing i dont like so much is camera
Is just good for use but not great as written 108mp is just like 32mp rear camera. Come to selfie is good and nice quality of selfies

So overall its a great phone for gamers those who play whole day."

Most part of this phone I like a lot.
The only con I felt right now display (in using it around 20days).
Since this is a stock android phone the App panel can be view only in white or black background.
There is no option of keeping your App tray background opaque which was there is my previous Motorola phones.

I knew we could use few launchers for achieving that opaque option but better to be use t...

Nowadays it's hard to find a clean android with oppo mi etc
Everywhere it's custom ui with ads

This is pure clean 2nd its a big phone and by big I mean size and plus weight of the phone
I guess they could have worked on the weight management plus if they had given glass material at back it would have given it a premium look
It must be because if the weight and size they went with plastic that feels like glass what do we call them?🤔anyw...

Now coming to the product...
Pros:
1. Display is good
2. Screen size is good
3. Camera is ok.
4. Look wise good.
Cons:
1. Battery back-up is not upto the expected level
2. Charging takes a lot of time
3. Some basic features like app lock, clone app, easy selection of Sim for SMS service etc are not available...also calculator and sim...

Pros:
Camera is decent.
Battery is good. It can last for a day on full charge on normal usage.

Cons:
Hangs a lot. Everyday even on normal usage it hangs for 3-4 times.
Big screen size because of which it doesn't fit properly even in jeans pocket
Feels heavy to hold for longer time. You will start to fell the pain in your palm.
No inbuilt AppLock. Have to download 3rd party app
Dual apps functionality is not present
Wifi turning on automatically sometimes"

Infact I am a fan of samsung, I want to change the device regarding the UI and performance. This device has not disappointed me. But the device weight is heavy. You have to get used to it. Other than that I am very happy. Camera is also different. The pictures look very natural, but the processing takes more time after the picture is taken."

9195,5,Phone works absolutely fine. Camera is ok. I like LCD display compared to AMOLED displays. So I'm happy with the display too. Audio quality is ok. Performance is very good. Battery life is really great. Experiencing stock Android which is awesome. Go for it if you get this phone for 16-17k.

9197,3,"This newly launched mobile by Motorola has been wonderful in its price range. With 108MP camera, quality of photos are little bit down in comparision to Samsung Galaxy M31. Performance is good and fast whereas battery backup is not so good.

Pros:
High resolution camera
6000mAh battery
Large screen
Fast and convenient to use
Amazing features including NFC

Cons:
Battery last for less than a day when used heavily
Charging is slow
Photos lack clarity"
9198,4,"The phone is good enough.

Display is good , lacks a bit in sun though.

Battery is cool , charges a bit slow when compared with the mi oppo or other Chinese phones but then slow and steady wins the race. So no problem with that as it keeps battery healthy and makes it work better in the long run.

Camera is not much used by me but then does the job although nothing amazing in this segment.

Best part is that UI is totally clean, no adds or bloatware which makes the phone look premium and pr...

Screen is really big and looks good
It take around 2 hours from 0 to 100
One thing that I love is it's OS, It's stock android
So no useless application
Very clean, smooth and best user experience

9624,4,"Phone is really good but some more features can be added to this. Like dedicated memory card slot, magnetic sensor, side fingerprint, ready for pc and 30W charger. And 108 mp camera is not up to the mark. Motorola needs to release an update for the camera optimization. Apart from this everything is good in this phone."
9625,4,Thanks
9626,5,"Phone display have some problem with respect touch some time and call ending button response is very slow battery is very good, camera is fine,"
9627,4,The overall activity of the phone is good but it doesn't propose anything new or exciting.The 108 mp camera doesn't appear any different.I have been a MOTO G user since MoToG 2 and have used till moto g5 plus before i got this one. Guess Motorola adds up something more.
9628,3,"That's The Best Phone in My Range battery backup is Awesome
And display is above 6 inches best Gaming Phone"
9629,5,"Phones Performance,battery,display is good...but Camera is not that much good as compared to 108 MP"

48 megapixel camera of redmi note 7 Pro is much better than Motorola G60 108 megapixel camera."
9631,5,The charging speed is very bad. Motorola is a huge disappointment.
9632,5,Phone does not work after 6 months of use. The first worst motorola phone i have ever used. Do not waste money in this phone
9633,5,"This mobile is best for this price, battery is good but the crazy 108mp camera is awesome.i am very happy"

Camera is awesome but speaker quality some how disappoints me... and battery draining lil quick while using internet ..6000mah but it won't last a single day if you continuously use internet.. may this problem resolve after update.. Overall it's a very good product. Must buy.
9640,5,This is great mobile 👍 superb build quality

9642,3,"The phone is good. Worth for money. If don't feel like buying a Chinese tech. You can go for this phone.
Camera features can be improved. 108 MP is good bit there is no much features like Samsung.
I am moto user for very long period. I love Moto."
9643,4,Those looking for pure Android experience with out bloat ware this is the mobile
9644,4,"Phone gives good performance, the battery life long lasting (6000mAh) but, it takes time to charge since the charger is of only 20W.
The camera is not good it's provided with 108p but doesn't perform as of 108p.
It's a smooth performing phone , good for gaming, heavy applications."
9645,5,This phone is simply superb bit big in size but I'm a loyal customer of Moto and Moto is keeping that promise so far
9646,4,"This is a great phone. I recommend this phone to those who are conflicted since there are tons of choices. Initially I was planning to get Nord 2 then realised Nord CE has same specs. After reading horrible reviews for CE, I settled for motorola.
If you want a clean, hassle free experience get this."
9647,4,"The device is just meet the needs and expectations. Durability of the device is good. Performance is also good.
But, the camera of the device is just ok, not up to the mark. It needs more improvements...

9663,5,thanks sir had a goog talk with us at that time our problem was well so thank you very much sir
9664,5,This is one of the best phones in this budget. It looks cool as its m logo is the fingerprint scanner. Many games can't use the full screen as it has a 6.68 inch big display. I played games for more than three hours and it consumed only 27 percent battery. Camera is also good. Over all it is great
9665,5,"The camera is great
The battery is large 6000 mph but it is draining faster with the time(after using for 2 months) mainly when the game mode is on.
There is some kind of gorilla glass which is good and not depicted in the description of mobile
Overall it's good"
9666,4,"The MOTO G60 is value for money.
If you don't have usage of the camera then moto G60 is the best option in the market.
No doubt, it's a little heavy in weight.
Performance is awesome!
Display screen quality is too good!
Watching a movie is super cool. The Speaker sound quality is super.

Overall this is a super cool phone."

Battery charging is falsely promised , it takes 4hr to get 85% charge while no apps are running."
9670,5,The phone is very bulky. It's larger and difficult to fit into a trouser pocket.
9671,5,"Phone is good,
Camera is very good।
Performance is also very good,
But battery is worst, it seems like 2500 mah ।


If u want battery,

9681,3,The phone is just as per my expectations and requirement. The only drawback is that the charger plug that came in the box does not work. I had to put the cable in another charger plug in order to charge the phone. Totally unexpected from Moto.
9682,5,Phone is good with clean software and 120hz is amazing. Battery is also good camera is better and there is a frount flash in frount camera phone is good in this price

9696,5,"The only cons I came across-
1.The device feels heavy in hands and pocket.
2. The camera is good but not great.
3. Does not come with a tempered glass. Have used extremely carefully for a month but still ended up with some minor scratches. Buying a tempered glass seperately is highly recommend."
9697,3,Thanks Flipkart... Excellent phone with good features
9698,5,"The Phone is bit heavy for me, as I like sleek cell phones.

One issue that I'm facing is that when someone end the call it take few seconds for screen to get rid off it.

When I cancels the call, it went off in seconds."

If you are looking for a phone with good performance and high security to save data safely this a must buy.

But if you are looking for a phone to watch OTTs, this is not for you. Even the sound quality on earphone when compared to my Samsung M30 is too bad.

Not worth the money you spend.
Choose wisely."

9780,4,"After using G60 for almost a week, it feels so fluid & smooth, be it on anything.

3. Performance is not satisfactory, hang on problems occurred."
9801,4,"After 3 months of usage i van say that it's a beast at this price .
Clean ui
Great battery life.
Though it's not amoled its a great display with120hz ... performance is good enough..
Just 1 thing which could have been great is rear camera performance though it's not bad...most of user won't feel any difference but at night or low light performance could have been better..."
9802,5,"After using a week i can say its totally average phone,photo editing is not upto standard, battery backup is somehow good,camera is not like 108mp, full charge taking tym.notification bar staying for long duration in screen,delete or any other processing takes tym.very worst phone i ever have."
9803,4,If you are a business persion this mobile for you.
9804,5,"After using Redmi mobiles, I feel the Moto system is not user friendly. Even there was no proper file manager, no proper app to open image files.

Battery and Camera are okay. Display is good. 108 Mp sensor is not up to the mark. Compared to Redmi / Real me it would be better.

Simply, Moto needs to develop/improve its system as a user friendlier."

-Touch is super smooth
-battery backup is also good
-performace is amazing, no lags even when multiple apps are running. Smooth transition from one app to another.
-only drawback is the position of fingerprint scanner and weight of the phone.
- overall at this price point the overall hardware and software experience is amazing."

9810,5,"If you want a premium experience plus a clean stock android at a reasonable price, Moto G60 is one of the best choice you can go for.
Pros-
1. The looks and back side of the phone are so attractive that people have been asking about the model and price of the phone.
2. The screen resolution and fluidity of the display is amazing.
3. 6000 Mah battery lasts long enough.
4. Camera is decent as per price range.
5. SD 732G processor works like a charm.
Cons-

It is quite long in hand. Though it has very good feeling in hand but it would look better and easy to carry if the length is bit small. Overall I must say it is worth buying."
9814,3,"After using three month, I am compulsions to write the reviews because this phone performance is pathetic. I will never buy any motorolla phone again. I am facing issues with performance and battery charging. It took too much time to charge."

9836,5,"After one week...
Feels like a solid phone with a long battery life and a vibrant camera. The interface is clean and Motorola don't load any spam apps so the experience of using this phone is enhanced. The perennial gesture features on Moto phones to turn on the torch or the camera instead of the tedious unlocking or swiping is a big win.

Only downside is the absence of a Gallery folder to access the pics and the lack of 5G connectivity.
Otherwise it's a phone built for more than what you'...

First, I play games like bgmi and cod. There is no lag or heating issue. Games run very smoothly with no frame drop. Basically I do 2-3 hour daily gaming, sometimes 4-5 hour daily. Gaming performance is best.

Battery is amazing, it last whole day with heavy gaming. Without Gaming and light use, you can use it even for 2 days.

Display is bright and beautiful. Don't worry about not having amoled display. You won't find much difference.

The display is bright, the colours are vibrant, and the sunlight legibility is good as well.The phone has 120Hz refresh rate. You can set it to 120Hz or 60Hz . Under the display options there are different options to adjust colours from Natural, Boosted and Saturated. There is also night light that lets you reduce the display and blue light emission, so it does not cause eye strain when you are reading at night....

10509,5,"Very good product at this price.
Pros:
1. Excellent Camera quality
2. Super performance
3. Big battery life gives almost 2 days battery backup on normal use.
4. Decent display
5. No heating issue while playing games

Cons:
1. Only concern is the width of the phone. As per the height of the phone width should be little bit more. At the time of viewing movies or videos in full-screen the top and bottom visuals will missed out.

Apart from this issue I don't have any problem with this phone. B...

10511,5,"Hello everyone,
First things first. This review is for anyone who has a 50-50 mindset for this phone, just like I had. I'm a Samsung fan and have bought G60 for my Father
- Camera _ Daytime it is outstanding for a midranger device. It crops the images at final outcome, but the end result is very nice at this price point. Night shoot is equally good but compromises a little on image detail and sharpness
- Chipset _ Snapdragon is hands-down the top performer. Moto has given the fastest 7 series...

10512,5,Well I have been using the device for quite a few days nd I must say I love the stock android experience it provides us with. The display is bright enough though its not super amoled. Camera is good as well. Overall I do recommend this device tho the only downside is its charger is only 20w. A 33 watt would have been better.
10513,3,"Best Motorola handset in this much low price, phone is smooth little bulky just because of battery and it is worth being bulky long lasting battery backup, screen so wide and large really enjoys watching videos and playing games, smooth processor never hangs , camera quality is upto the mark as mentioned really loved the product you should definitely go for this !"
10514,4,"Never buy this product. Did not get as expected. Phone getting hanged, battery back up very poor , over all performance very poor. Better to buy oppo, vivo or best mi. It's a honest review ..I was using mi before it was better than this"
10515,5,"Cell Phone is a compact product by Motorola.
I am completely satisfied with the product.
Outstanding battery life. Camera is awesome.
Would request moto to add some more features like a dedicated Galary."
10516,4,"Very good/Best phone in this price range. Compared to Redmi note 10 pro, since it has Amoled display, there is some heating issues and also it is not balanced properly like auto brightness. But in this everything is well balanced, In all aspects, like call quality, Haptic Touch. Addition to that battery life is in to next level."
10517,4,Very Good Performances with good battery life and speed was low bit compared to other phones and camera clarity was good
10518,5,Very good phone. In future would like to have security updates for more duration and like to have higher on board storage models of 256 Gb and 512 Gb.

10806,3,"Review after 1 week. Battery life is good. Display is good but auto brightness is not perfect. Performance is also good not excellent. Camera performance is also good. Some said Gcam will be better, have to try. Built quality is good but could have designed better. Frosted Champaign is better one than the other. Stock Android is smooth.

Conclusion
At this price segment G60 will be a better option than other phones both performance wise and software wise. So go for it."

Recently I purchased moto g60 and there is quality issues i.e. camera quality not good as expected since 108mp and very slow charging but as per specifications its mentioned turbo charging and when you making calls recording it's intimate to receiver to that you call is recording its very worst options. Processor Speed also worst.
11272,5,Very nice
